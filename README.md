# ðŸ›’ Store Data Analysis

This project is about analyzing store sales and inventory data using Microsoft Excel.

I downloaded the dataset from **Kaggle**, cleaned it, and used Excel tools like Pivot Tables, charts, and conditional formatting to find:

- Which products are selling the most
- Which items are low in stock
- Monthly sales trends
- Overall revenue and category performance

I also added slicers and filters to make the dashboard easy to explore.

ðŸ“Š This project shows how Excel can turn simple store data into useful business insights.
